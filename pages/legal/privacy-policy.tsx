              </h2>
              <p>
                Our top priority is customer data security, and, as such, we may
                process only minimal user data, only as much as it is absolutely
                necessary to maintain the website. Information collected
                automatically is used only to identify potential cases of abuse
                and establish statistical information regarding website usage.
                This statistical information is not otherwise aggregated in such
                a way that it would identify any particular user of the system.
              </p>
              <p>
                You can visit the website without telling us who you are or
                revealing any information, by which someone could identify you
                as a specific, identifiable individual. If, however, you wish to
                use some of the website’s features, or you wish to receive our
                newsletter or provide other details by filling a form, you may
                provide personal data to us, such as your email, first name,
                last name, city of residence, organization, telephone number.
                You can choose not to provide us with your personal data, but
                then you may not be able to take advantage of some of the
                website’s features. For example, you won’t be able to receive
                our Newsletter or contact us directly from the website. Users
                who are uncertain about what information is mandatory are
